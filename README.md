# CNN_Based_Digit-Recognition
This is a deep learning neural networks based model which uses Convolutional Neural Networks for the prediction of Handwritten Digits and trained on the MNIST Handwritten Digit dataset <br>
Tensorflow needs to be installed on machine running this model, the link for installation can found here https://www.tensorflow.org/install <br>
The dataset can be found on Kaggle, please refer to this link https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data<br>
A basic of understanding of Convolutional Neural Network will be sufficient for understanding the project.
